    <h3><i>Experience Summary</i></h3>
    <p>I have experience in working with the public, as well as counting money and running a cash register. This experience I got while working at Village Park in Kannapolis. I also have some experience in the automotive industry, such as minor detailing, oil changes, and being a part of my college's Auto Club and an active member of the car community.</p>
    <h3><i>My Percieved Calling</i></h3>
    <p>I feel that my calling is to share the gospel to not large groups, but to people one at a time. In my experience, I can establish a closer connection when I am talking to just one or two people. In my career, I can use this when engaging with people.</p>
